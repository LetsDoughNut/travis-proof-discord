# Travis CI Proof for Discord
This is a Travis "proof".
This code executes a known code with a secret that only Travis CI holds

This proof is invalid if:
- The commit cannot be found on GitHub
- The code is fabricated to not reflect the true statistics
- The Eris client is a different one to what is on NPM

Please compare this code to the one found at:
https://github.com/moustacheminer/travis-proof-discord

For an example, please visit the latest commit for the Travis CI build information.
